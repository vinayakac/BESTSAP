== Description ==

**The Fastest and Most Powerful WordPress Sidebar Plugin yet. Create tailored widget areas for any post, page, or custom post type in seconds. No coding required!**

Content Aware Sidebars is packed with free features and is being used to boost on-site SEO, upsell products, and to optimize conversion rates by displaying different sidebars on different conditions.

Focusing on scalability, this plugin is the ideal solution for sites in growth.

####Add Unlimited Sidebars and Widget Areas

Replace your theme sidebars on different conditions, or insert sidebars with shortcodes. With the All-in-one Sidebar Manager, you can easily activate and deactivate widget areas, and you can even schedule them for specific times. 

Sidebars - Quick Select&copy; lets you add or select widget areas directly when editing a post or page.

####Customize Your Widget Areas Your Way

Without writing any code, you can modify the HTML and CSS classes of widget areas, widgets, and widget titles. You get full control over the look and feel of your sidebars and widget areas, no matter what theme you use.

Sidebar Visibility lets you elegantly hide any widget area for logged-out users.

####The Most User-friendly Widget Manager

If you have more than just a few widgets and widget areas, you will love the Enhanced Widget Manager. When adding new widgets to sidebars, Live Search will find widgets in seconds, and the smart split-screen gives you a much better overview of your widget options.

1-Click Sidebar Activation&copy; lets you activate or deactivate widget areas instantly.

####Show or Hide Sidebars on Any Page (Yes, any)

Create a post sidebar, a page sidebar, a category sidebar, or any custom sidebar you need, without confusing widget logic code. You can even combine conditions in any way you like, so you can display widgets and custom sidebars on all posts in a select category and written by a specific author.

Display your widget areas on any of these conditions:

* Posts, Pages & Custom Post Types
* Content with Tags, Categories, or Custom Taxonomies
* Content written by select Authors
* Page Templates
* Blog Page & Post Type Archives
* Author Archives
* Taxonomy Archives
* Date Archives
* Front Page, Search Results, 404 Not Found Page
* bbPress Profiles, Forums & Topics
* BuddyPress Profile Sections
* Languages (WPML, Polylang, qTranslate X, Transposh)
* Pods Pages
* **Any Combination of Above**

####Sidebar Plugin Integrations and Support

Content Aware Sidebars automatically supports Custom Post Types and Taxonomies created by any plugin or theme. Built-in support for some of the most popular WordPress plugins means that you e.g. can create WooCommerce sidebars for select products or BuddyPress sidebars for your members.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this sidebar plugin work with my theme? =

Yes!

If your theme already has WordPress sidebars and widget areas, you can create new custom sidebars to replace, merge with or hide those on certain conditions.

You can also display custom sidebars using the sidebar shortcode [ca-sidebar id=""] anywhere in your content.

If your theme has a built-in sidebar generator, it is recommended to disable it and/or only use Content Aware Sidebars for maximum speed and compatibility.

= Will this plugin work with page builders? =

Yes!

Many users already mix Content Aware Sidebars with popular page builder plugins such as Elementor, SiteOrigin Page Builder, Beaver Builder, and Visual Composer.

= Do I need to know widget logic code? =

Nope.

Content Aware Sidebars is praised by users for its unparalleled sidebar and widget visibility options. It's the only plugin that allows you to display widget areas on literally any condition without any code. 

= Can I really display sidebars and widget areas on any page? =

Yep.

In the Sidebar Editor, you can select where, when and to whom your sidebar should be displayed. Create a sidebar for each page, a sidebar for posts in a category, or any sidebar you need, all in a user-friendly UI.

You can also select sidebars directly when you're editing a post or page.
